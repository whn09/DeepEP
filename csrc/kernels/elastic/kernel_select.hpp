//
//   "unordered" (default) — per-part batched puts with in-band token headers and
//                           counting signals. Makes no assumption about network
//                           delivery order, so strong signal is not required, and
//                           weak signal is enough.
//
//   "ordered"             — the upstream kernels: the sender publishes a tail via a
//                           trailing signal and the receiver assumes all data
//                           preceding the tail has landed. Requires the backend to
//                           support strong signals and VA signals.
//
// The value is read once per process. It changes the JIT-generated source (header and
// kernel names differ), so the JIT cache distinguishes the two variants automatically.
